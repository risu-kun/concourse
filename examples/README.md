# Concourse Examples
This directory contains examples for different kinds of data, operations and
applications for which you can use Concourse. Where possible, we try to show
implementations using Concourse and at least one other database system for
comparison.

These examples are only meant to be illustrative, so we don't always follow
ideal coding guidelines (i.e. we want the examples to be contained and
straightforward so we don't necessarily abstract things properly or use the best
object oriented practices). You should only use these examples to understand
concepts and never copy any of this code directly to your application.

## Creating a new example project
The `create-example-project` script simplifies the process of bootstrapping a
new example project with the appropriate files.
```bash
$ ./create-example-project <project-name> <project-language>
$ cd project-name/project-language
```
